📈 Regression Models with Scikit-Learn

This repository contains multiple regression models implemented using scikit-learn and developed within Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. The project focuses on building, training, and comparing different regression techniques to determine the most effective model.

🔍 Model Evaluation

All models are evaluated using the R² (coefficient of determination) metric, which measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. This enables a clear and objective comparison across models.

🚀 Key Features

Multiple regression models implemented with scikit-learn

Fully reproducible experiments in Jupyter Notebooks

Performance comparison using R² score

Clean, transparent, and well-documented workflow

Easy to extend and experiment with new models

🧪 How to Use

Clone the repository

Open the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Run the notebooks to train, evaluate, and compare regression models

🤝 Contributions

Contributions, improvements, and experiments are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and test the models on new datasets.
